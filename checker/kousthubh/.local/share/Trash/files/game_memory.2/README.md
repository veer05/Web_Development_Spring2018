# react-memory-game

This is a memory game app built with React. It was built with the purpose of helping teach React by example. You can follow the step by step process by walking through the commits starting from the beginning.

Note that there are many helpful in-line comments that provide background and explanation.

## Setup

- Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

- `npm run serve` will run the app at `localhost:4000`. You will notice that hot loading is enabled so changes you make will magically appear without refreshing. (this works for most things but certain state changes you may have to actually refresh). If you install more dependencies you will need to restart the server.
